## To Run

### Server

In order to run the server, you will need mongoDB running on your computer locally.
To run the application, start the server as found in the Server folder.

If you want to seed the database with dummy data, you can run this command.

> npm seed

Otherwise, run the following command to start the server.

> npm start

The server should be running on port 4000.

### Client

In order to run the client, navigate to the goodhood folder.

Run the following command to start the server.

> npm start

This should work, running on port 3000.

Good Luck!
